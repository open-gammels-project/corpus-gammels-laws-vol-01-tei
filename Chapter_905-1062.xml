<p>2d. That Texas is no longer, morally or civilly, bound by the Compact of Union; yet, stimulated by the generosity and sympathy common to a free people, they offer their support and assistance to such of the Members of the Mexican Confederacy as will take up arms against military despot<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ism.</p>
