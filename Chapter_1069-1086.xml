All citizens now living in Texas, who have not received their portion of land, in like manner as colonists, shall be entitled to their land in the following proportion and manner: Every head of a family shall be entitled to one league and labor of land; and <pb n="1080" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="20" /><fw type="header" place="top">Constitution of the Republic of texas.</fw>every single man of the age of seventeen and upwards, shall be entitled to the third part of one league of land. All citizens who may have previously to the adoption of this constitution, received their league of land as heads of families, and their quarter of a league of land as single persons, shall receive such additional quan<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tity as will make the quantity of land received by them equal to one league and labor, and one third of a league, unless by bargain, sale, or exchange, they have transferred or may henceforth transfer their right to said land, or a portion thereof, to some other citizen of the republic: and in such case, the person to whom such right shall have been transferred shall be entitled to the same, as fully and amply as the person making the transfer might or could have been.&#8212;No alien shall hold land in Texas, except by titles emanating directly from the government of this republic. But if any citizen of this republic should die intestate or otherwise, his children or heirs shall inherit his estate, and aliens shall have a reasonable time to take possession of and dispose of the same, in a manner here<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />after to be pointed out by law. Orphan children whose parents were entitled to land under the colonization laws of Mexico, and who now reside in the republic, shall be entitled to all the rights of which their parents were possessed at the time of their death. The citizens of the republic shall not be compelled to reside on the land, but shall have their lines plainly marked.</p>
<p>All orders of survey legally obtained by any citizen of the repub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lic, from any legally authorized commissioner, prior to the act of the late consultation closing the land offices, shall be valid. In all cases the actual settler and occupant of the soil shall be entitled, in locating his land, to include his improvement, in preference to all other claims not acquired previous to his settlement, according to the law of the land and this constitution&#8212;provided, that noth<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing herein contained shall prejudice the rights of any other citizen from whom a settler may hold land by rent or lease.</p>
<p>And whereas, the protection of the public domain from un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />just and fraudulent claims, and quieting the people in the enjoy<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of their lands, is one of the great duties of this convention; and whereas the legislature of Coahuila and Texas having pass<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed an act in the year 1834, in behalf of general John T.

Mason, and of the 14th of March, 1835, of the said legislature of Coahuila and Texas, and each and every grant founded thereon, is, and was from the beginning, null and void; and all surveys made under pretence of authority derived from said acts, are hereby declared to be null and void: and all eleven league claims, located within twenty leagues of the boundary line between Texas and the United States of America, which have been located contrary to the laws of Mex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ico, are hereby declared to be null and void. And whereas many surveys and titles to lands have been made whilst most of the peo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ple of Texas were absent from home, serving in the campaign against Bexar, it is hereby declared that all the surveys and loca<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions of land made since the act of the late consultation closing the land offices, and all titles to land made since that time, are, and shall be null and void.</p>
<p>And whereas the present unsettled state of the country and the general welfare of the people demand that the operations of the land office, and the whole land system shall be suspended until persons serving in the army can have a fair and equal chance with those remaining at home, to select and locate their lands, it is here<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />by declared, that no survey or title which may hereafter be made shall be valid, unless such survey or title shall be authorized by this convention, or some future congress of the republic. And with a view to the simplification of the land system, and the protection of the people and the government from litigation, and fraud, a general land office shall be established, where all the land titles of the republic shall be registered, and the whole territory of the republic shall, be sectionized, in a manner hereafter to be prescribed by law, which shall enable the officers of the government or any citizen, to ascertain with certainty the lands that are vacant, and those lands which may be covered with valid titles.</p>
<p>SEC. 11. Any amendment, or amendments to this consti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tution, may be proposed in the house of representatives or senate, and if the same shall be agreed to by a majority of the members elected to each of the two houses, such proposed amendment or amendments shall be entered on the journals, with the yeas and nays thereon, and referred to the congress then next to be chosen, and shall be published for three months previous to the elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1082" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="22" /><fw type="header" place="top">Constitution of the Republic of texas.</fw>tion; and if the congress next chosen as aforesaid, shall pass said amendment or amendments by a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, then it shall be the duty of said congress to submit said proposed amendment or amendments to the people, in such manner and at such times as the congress shall prescribe; and if the people shall approve and ratify such amendment or amendments by a majority of the electors quali<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied to vote for members of congress voting thereon, such amend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment or amendments shall become a part of this constitution: Provided, however, that no amendment or amendments be referred to the people oftener than once in three years.</p>
