        <dateline>No. 72. DATED <date>18th AUGUST, 1824</date>.</dateline>
        <p>The Sovereign General Congress, assembled for the purpose of fram<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no"/>ing the Constitution of the United Mexican States, has decreed as fol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no"/>lows:&#x2014;</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 1.&#x2014;The Mexican Nation offers to those foreigners who may be desirous of settling in her territory security for their persons and prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no"/>erty, provided they obey the laws of the country.</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 2.&#x2014;This law relates to those lands, national property, which, as belonging to no individual, corporation or town, may be occupied by settlers.</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 3.&#x2014;For this purpose the Congresses of the states shall as speedily as possible frame laws or regulations for the colonization of those lands which appertain to them, conforming in every respect with the fundamental Constitutional Act, the General Constitution, and the regulations established by this law,</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 4.&#x2014;No lands lying within 20 leagues of the boundaries with any foreign nation, nor within 10 leagues of the coast, can be occupied by settlers, without the previous approbation of the Supreme Executive Power.</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 5.&#x2014;If, with a view to the defence or security of the nation, the government of the federation should think fit to occupy any of the lands, in order to construct magazines, arsenals, or other public build<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no"/>ings, it is empowered so to do, with the approbation of the general Congress, and during its recess with that of the Council of Government.</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 6.&#x2014;Until 4 years from the publication of this law, no impost shall be levied for the admission of those foreigners who may come for the first time, in order to settle in the nation.</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 7.&#x2014;-Until the year 1840 the general Congress shall not prohibit the admission of foreigners to colonize, excepting, indeed, circumstances should imperiously oblige it so to do, with regard to the individuals of any nation.</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 8.&#x2014;The Government, without defeating the purposes of this law, shall take those measures of precaution which it may deem expe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no"/>dient for the security of the federation, with regard to those foreigners who may come to colonise.</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 9.&#x2014;In the distribution of lands a preference is to be given to Mexican citizens, and between them no other distinction shall be made <pb n="98" ed="gammelslawsoftexas"/><pb ed="unknown" n="98"/><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of Colonization.</fw>than that to which individual merit, or services rendered to the country, may justify, or, where in other cases a parity exists, residence in the part to which the lands appertain.</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 10.&#x2014;Those military men who, agreeably to the offer of the 27th March, 1821, have a right to lands, shall be recompensed on presenting the documents with which the Supreme Executive Power shall for that purpose provide them.</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 11.&#x2014;If, according to decrees for paying off the principal accord<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no"/>ing to a calculation of the probability, of the length of life of the in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no"/>cumbent, the Supreme Executive Power should think proper to alienate any portions of land in favour of any public servants of the federation, military or civil, it is impowered so to do, with the government lands of the territories of the Republic.</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 12.&#x2014;In the possession of no individual shall be allowed to be united, as his own property, more than one square league of 5000 yards of lands fit for irrigation, 4 of arable land not irrigated, and 6 of pasture land.</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 13.&#x2014;The new settlers are not permitted to transfer their prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no"/>erty to religious communities.</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 14.&#x2014;This law guarantees the contracts which speculators may make with those families which they may convey at their own expense, provided they are not contrary to the laws.</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 15.&#x2014;No one who in virtue of this law obtains possession of lands, can hold them if settled out of the territory of the Republic.</p>
        <p>A<smcap>RT</smcap>. 16.&#x2014;The government agreeably to the principles established in this law shall proceed to colonise the territories of the Republic.</p>
