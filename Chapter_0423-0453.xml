The president shall afterwards also enquire if any bribery, subornation, or force has been used for the election of any particular person, and should it be proved in the act that there has, the delinquents shall be de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no"/>prived of a voice, active and passive, and false accusers shall suffer the same penalty.
